        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>A very filling protein shake that contains a lot of ingredients. In the recipe below, we will assume that you measured the weight of the ingredients beforehand. If you haven't, you can simply place the blender on top of a kitchen scale and place the ingredients one by one to make sure you are using the correct amount. I myself use this method.</p>
        <p>Because this shake has so many ingredients, it is recommended to consider it a meal. I myself drink it every morning for breakfast</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>A Blender</li>
            <li>A Kitchen Scale</li>
            <li>250g of Milk</li>
            <li>100g of Water</li>
            <li>1 scoop of your preferred protein powder</li>
            <li>1 Banana</li>
            <li>60g of Oats</li>
            <li>30g of Peanut Butter</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Optional</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>5g of Creatine</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>First, pour in your 250g of milk and 100g of water in the blender.</li>
            <li>Next, break your banana into smaller pieces and place it in the blender</li>
            <li>Now, scoop out 30g of peanut butter (if you need to measure, read the description) and place it in the blender.</li>
            <li>Then, deposit 60g of oats in your blender. Preferrably use rolled or quick oats instead of steel cut oats.</li>
            <li>Next, use the scoop included in your tub of protein powder to throw in one scoop of protein. If you're a big boy with big protein needs then you can use 2 scoops.</li>
            <li>Optionally, include 5g of creatine.</li>
            <li>Blend and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
