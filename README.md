This project is a quick little website the includes 3 recipes that I used to survive college. 

For now, everything is built using simple html. I used links on the homepage that will take you to the different recipes. For each of the recipes
I used images to kind of illustrate how each recipe will look in the end, and used lists and headers to format the pages clearly.
